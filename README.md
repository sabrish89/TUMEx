Hello !<br/>

Welcome to my submission<br/>

This project was created using vscode and cmake 3.20.0 on Win 10 with gcc 8.1.0 ( mingw-w64 ). 
The executable is `build/exercise` provided already in  the repo, however can be rebuilt using cmake.

<u>Some Points:</u><br/>
1. The application requires two inputs:
	1. Resolution per step: This is a positive integer, denotes the milliseconds each simulation step spends/exhausts.
	2. Number of agents: This is a positive integer as well, denotes the total agents to exist in the sim env.

2. The output consists of:
	1. A summary for each agent when it exits the sim.
	2. Mean and Std.dev, of Trip Length and Travel Time. for each agent type, over the sim.
                                                                                             
Lastly, thank you for the exercise, it was a lot of fun. 
Let me know in case of any issues. I would be happy to help 😊.<br/>                                                                           <b>- Sabrish Gopalakrishnan</b>
